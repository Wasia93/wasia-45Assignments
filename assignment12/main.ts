// assignment12:
// Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11,
//  but instead of just printing each person’s name, 
//  print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same,
//  but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.

let names = ["samra","ramsha","wasia"]
for (let val of names){
    console.log(`welcome ${val}`)
}
